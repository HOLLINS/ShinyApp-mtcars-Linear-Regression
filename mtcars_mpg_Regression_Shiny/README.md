### Linear Regression of Miles/Gallon(mpg) with One or More Predictors



This repository contains a Shiny application that imports mtcars data and fit linear regression models with mpg as the outcome and the selected features as the predictors.


The application shows model coefficients returned by the modeling function and plots 4 diagnostic plots. It is also deployed on shinyapps.io [mtcars_mpg_Regression](http://omaymas.shinyapps.io/mtcars_mpg_Regression)
